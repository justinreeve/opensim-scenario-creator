opensim-scenario-creator
========================
This is a "middleware app" between OpenSim and LSL. It is still in early alpha, but is aimed at developing quest-based learning scenarios for OpenSim. Loosely inspired by Scratch for OpenSim, the Scenario Creator provides an easy web-based interface, intended for ages 8 and up, to script OpenSim regions quickly without having to know the Linden Scripting Language. It directly integrates with an OpenSim install, so copying/pasting code is not required, and updates are made in-world in real-time.
